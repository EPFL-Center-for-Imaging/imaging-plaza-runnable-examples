[docker_images](./docker_images/): runnable examples as docker images. They can be pulled (or built) and run to launch a **JupyterLab** session. The requirements are already installed in the container.

[notebooks](./notebooks/): runnable examples as notebooks. They can be launched on **Binder** or **Google Colab**. The requirements are installed via `!pip install my_package` at the top of the notebook.
